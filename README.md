# SMS Spam Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based SMS spam classification system. 
The objective is to automatically classify text messages as either *spam* or *ham* 
using natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **SMSSpamCollection**, which contains labeled SMS messages.
Each message is categorized as spam or non-spam (ham).

## Methodology
The implementation follows these steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Text cleaning and normalization
3. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
4. Model training using multiple classifiers
5. Model evaluation and comparison

## Models Implemented
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
The models demonstrate effective classification of SMS messages, with Naive Bayes
showing strong performance on sparse text data.
